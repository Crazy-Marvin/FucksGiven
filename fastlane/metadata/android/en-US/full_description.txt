Fucks Given lets you keep track of the things that made you care. Whenever something happens that you needlessly concern yourself with, jot it down with a tap. The app creates a chart of how many fucks youâ€™ve given, so you can work to give none.
 
Fucks Given allows you to back up your data and has a beautiful dark mode that can turn on automatically, following the system theme.
